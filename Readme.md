## 📥 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your custom localhost homepage:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HappyBananaWorld/Rootly
```

### 2. Copy `index.php` to Your Localhost Root

Depending on your local server (WAMP or XAMPP), move the `index.php` file to your root directory:

#### For **WAMP** (default path):
```
C:\wamp64\www\
```

#### For **XAMPP** (default path):
```
C:\xampp\htdocs\
```

> This will replace the default landing page with your new custom dashboard.

### 3. Open in Browser

Now, simply visit:

```
http://localhost/
```

And enjoy your personalized local environment homepage 🎉
